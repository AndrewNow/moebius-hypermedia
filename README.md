# moebius-hypermedia
# To create a new publication, you must create a new branch with the name of the artwork. 
# Once the branch is deployed, create a new subdomain on the dev.revuemoebius@gmail.com Vercel account at https://vercel.com/devrevuemoebius-gmailcom/moebius-hypermedia/settings/domains 
# The branch should be assigned to that subdomain in order to upload properly, do this once you finish the next step
# Be sure to add the TXT record to fix the "Domain pending verification" error. Update the record on the revue-moebius Vercel *account*, not the project page (currently on andrewnow's account) Do so here: https://vercel.com/dashboard/domains/revuemoebius.com 
# Once uploaded, simply add the URL to the CMS on the primary Revue Moebius repo!
